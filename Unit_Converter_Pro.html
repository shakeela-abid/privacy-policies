      <h1>Privacy Policy for Unit Converter Pro</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 7, 2025</p>

      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to Unit Converter Pro ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile
  application Unit Converter Pro (the "App"). By using our App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Information We DO NOT Collect</h3>
      <p>Unit Converter Pro is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
          <li>Location data</li>
          <li>Device identifiers</li>
          <li>Usage analytics or tracking data</li>
          <li>Your conversion calculations or inputs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Local Data Storage</h3>
      <p>The App stores the following data locally on your device only:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Your favorite conversions (stored locally for quick access)</li>
          <li>App preferences and settings</li>
          <li>Currency exchange rate cache (for offline functionality)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data never leaves your device and is not transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</p>

      <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Currency Exchange Rates</h3>
      <p>Our App fetches live currency exchange rates from external APIs. When requesting currency rates:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>No personal information is sent with these requests</li>
          <li>Only the currency codes are transmitted</li>
          <li>We cache rates locally to minimize external requests</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3.2 Advertising</h3>
      <p>Our App may display advertisements through Google AdMob. AdMob may collect and use data according to their privacy policy. We recommend reviewing Google's privacy
   policy at: https://policies.google.com/privacy</p>
      <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device settings.</p>

      <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
      <p>Since we don't collect personal data, there's minimal risk to your privacy. All local data is stored securely on your device using standard encryption methods
  provided by the operating system.</p>

      <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our App is safe for users of all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we don't collect personal data from any
  users, this policy applies to all age groups.</p>

      <h2>6. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>As we don't collect personal data, there are no international data transfers of your personal information. Currency rate requests are made to international APIs
  but contain no personal data.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>Since we don't collect personal data, traditional data protection rights (access, rectification, erasure) don't apply. However, you can:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Clear your locally stored favorites through the app settings</li>
          <li>Uninstall the app to remove all local data</li>
          <li>Disable ads through your device's advertising settings</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last
  updated" date. Changes are effective when posted.</p>

      </ul>

      <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Since we don't collect personal data on our servers, there's no data retention policy for personal information. Local data remains on your device until you delete
   it or uninstall the app.</p>
